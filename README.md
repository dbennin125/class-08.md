Re-reading the chapter and my take away is that layouts are broken down into blocks. Like tetris you can position blocks in way that flexs, creates columns, creats rows of divs, as well as using id to make style single boxes.
z-index seems helpful, along with overflow:auto as well as the liquid layout.
the 960 pixel grid makes sense and I'd like to try it in the future. Maybe on the weekend when I have time.
I missed this the first time but you can also have multiple style sheets in the same page.
